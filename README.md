# 🔍 ModelExplainer: Interpreting Machine Learning with Explainable AI (XAI)

Welcome to **ModelExplainer**! In this project, we’ll delve into the world of Explainable AI, where we’ll interpret machine learning models to understand their decision-making processes. From identifying key predictors to understanding individual predictions, we’ll explore the “why” behind each prediction. Let’s make machine learning more transparent! 🌐🤖

## 🌐 Project Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) enhances transparency in predictive analytics by interpreting machine learning models. In this project, we’ll work with the UCI Census Income dataset to predict if an individual earns more than $50k/year and explain why models make certain predictions. We'll use three distinct models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network—and explain them through different methods, both globally and locally.
